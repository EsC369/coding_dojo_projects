# CSS Basics

## Px vs %

Static pages that will not change use px.

Responsive design use %

## Beware of the height property

Setting the height property can restrict the amount of content an element can hold, leaving it unset will allow it to expand to expand to fit all its contents.

## Overflow Property

This property determines what should happen when the content inside of a container is too much for the container size.

Possible Settings:

* Hide the additional information that does not fit
* Show the information no matter what
* Have a scroll bar added to the element so the content is contained but still viewable

## Dynamic Resizing

Setting just the width or height will cause the other to adjust appropriately to keep the relative dimensions of the element.
